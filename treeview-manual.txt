<h1>Tree View</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <b>tree view</b> displays any array of paths (e.g. '\\a\\b\\c\\d\\', 'a\\b\\b', 'a\\c' etc) in Windows path format (not URL or Linux) as a hierarchy based on the specified style template (or default if nothing is specified).</p>
<p>There are a number of pure CSS style templates that are uploaded with the plugin. These can all be altered to suit your design. There are also a range of other templates available.</p>
<p>The hierachy list has a number of sources that can be specified from S3 structures, file structures, upload folders, plugin folders, page hierarchy or a custom list.</p>
<p>Up to <b>7</b> levels of hierarchy can be displayed in any one tree.</p>
<p>End-nodes in the tree can hyperlink to files or other links so it can be used as a navigation tool.
<p>If media files are found as an end-node in a file tree, the image can be included in the tree as an image tile.</p>
<p>This can be combined with the <b>Wolfe Candy Tool Suite</b> for enriched functionality e.g. S3 bucket folder lists and using <b>Private Content</b> shortcode to limit the viewing of tree structures to specified roles.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Follow the usual Wordpress instructions to install the plugin files. Either copy a ZIP archive of the plugin folder contents into the Word Press plugins folder or install it directly from the Wordpress repositiory.</p>
<p>Additional icon and template sets can also be uploaded as ZIP.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> If using tree view with file and folder functionality you will only be able to list or show links to files and structures that the web server has sufficient permissions granted by the underlying file structure to do so. If the web server does not have access then it will not show any node that it does not have access to. If there are no permissions or an incorrect path is passed then the tree may be blank.</p>

<h2>Shortcode</h2>
<p>The following shortcode command can be inserted into any page, post or widget:</p>
<li><b>[show-tree]</b> displays a tree at the shortcode position. Optional arguments can be included to influence the behaviour of the tree using <b>[show-tree arg1="value1" arg2="value2" ...]</b> 
<p>NB: each tree is associated to a style template* - only 1 style template can be used per page or else they will combine into junk. However - you can have as many trees as you want on a page as long as they use the same style template.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The following arguments can be used in the shortcode or as POST/GET arguments: </p>
<li><b>[tree_source = "'\\a\\b\\c\\d\\', 'a\\b\\b', 'a\\c'"]</b> - any list can be passed in filename format
<li><b>[root = "\\"]</b> - the start point or subfolder from which to display the tree
<li><b>[style_template = "default"]</b> CSS template* to use. If nothing is specified then the "default" template will used.
<li><b>[icon_home = ""]</b> icons** can be specified as icon names or special characters/html entities using <b>&xx;</b> - see the instruction manual on <b>Special Characters</b>
<li><b>[icon_middle = ""]</b> 
<li><b>[icon_endpoint = ""]</b>
<li><b>[style_collapse = "true"]</b> the tree is dynamic so that branches can collapse or expand by clicking the node rather than a fixed view of all branches
<li><b>[source = "page-hierarchy"]</b> is the imported source*** of the path list if not manually specified
<li><b>[endpoint_filter=""]</b> // CSV list of matches to include - spaces count in search in format .png,.jpg,.pdf (.png or .jpg or .pdf)
<li><b>[tree_filter=""]</b> CSV list of matches to include - spaces count in search
<li><b>[hidden_filter = "true"]</b> exclude files or folders starting with "."
<li><b>[endpoint_link = "true"]</b>enables the endpoint as a hyperlink if one is set, or false to disallow all links
<li><b>[endpoint_image = "true"]</b> displays an image tile if the endpoint is a media file
<li><b>[endpoint_image_size = "30"]</b> size in pixels of a square image tile

<p>The tree can be called using the class <b>WlfC_Treeview</b>. The following are available methods and arguments:</p>
<li>All of the arguments in the Usage section are available e.g. <b>[style_template="template"]</b> is called as <b>$class->style_template="";</b>
<li><b>HTML_out = "";</b> - stores the result of the <b>BuildTree</b> method
<li><b>style_order = "ul";</b> or "ol" for numbered list
<li><b>slug = "";</b> is the plugin name
<li><b>endpoint_link_pattern = "<a href='[endpoint_url]'>[endpoint_name]</a>"; </b> is the pattern to use to create a hyperlink at each endpoint. Other examples are:<ul>
<li><b>endpoint_link_pattern = "<a href='[return_url]'>[endpoint_name]</a>"; </b> example to return POST endpoint name to calling page to process using different plugin shortcode
<li><b>endpoint_link_pattern = "<a href='https://custom.wordpress.url.slug?endpoint=[endpoint_name]'>[endpoint_name]</a>"; </b> example to return POST endpoint name to another specified page to process it
<li><b>endpoint_link_pattern = "<a href='[calling_url]?ep=[endpoint_name]&epu=[endpoint_url]'>[endpoint_name]</a>"; </b> example to return custom POST args to the calling page</ul>
<li><b>endpoint_integration_call = "";  alternative function to call to provide the endpoint_url based on endpoint_name
<li>Method <b>AddNodeList($nodes)</b> to manually add items to the list
<li>Method <b>BuildTree()</b> returns the HTML and populates <b>HTML_out</b>
<li>Method <b>GetNestedNodes($node)</b> returns a distinct array of all list items that match the <b>$node</b> at the next nest_level/sub level
<li>Method <b>GetIcon($icon, $isize='s')</b> returns the IMG tag HTML for the specified icon (see icon list above)
<li>Method <b>ImportSource($source)</b> imports the path list from a number of different sources
